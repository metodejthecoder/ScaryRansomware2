THIS MALWARE IS NOT A JOKE

Made in C#
.NET 4.0

What it does?
After execution, it extracts its files, copies them to C:\, changes wallpaper and username, disables keyboard, removes access to files, makes some changes in registry,
disables UAC and restarts computer. (This process usually takes about 6 seconds until restart)

After boot, your username is I FOUND YOU!, keyboard is disabled, (you will maybe need on-screen keyboard if you have password), wallpaper is
changed to creepy image, League Of Legends music starts playing, then window will popup and taskbar will be gone, and MBR is overwritten.

Use it only on VM with non-important files.

Supports: Windows 7 and above.
